                    AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular" or "Angular.js") is a complete JavaScript-based open-source client-side web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.
                    The JavaScript components complement PhoneGap, the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps.
                    It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

                <p>
                    The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC, Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and approximately 8,400 other sites out of 1 million tested in July 2015.

                    <p>AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic.[3] The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.

                        AngularJS's design goals include:

                        to decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
                        to decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
                        to provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
                        Angular implements the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components. Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.</p>

                <md-content class="md-padding">
                    <h1 class="md-display-2">Scope</h1>
                    <p>Angular uses the term "scope" in a manner akin to the fundamentals of computer science.

                        Scope in computer science describes when in the program a particular binding is valid. The ECMA-262 specification defines scope as: a lexical environment in which a Function object is executed in client-side web scripts; akin to how scope is defined in lambda calculus.

                        As a part of the "MVC" architecture, the scope forms the "Model", and all variables defined in the scope can be accessed by the "View" as well as the "Controller". The scope behaves as a glue and binds the "View" and the "Controller".

                        In Angular, "scope" is a certain kind of object that itself can be in scope or out of scope in any given part of the program, following the usual rules of variable scope in JavaScript like any other object. When the term "scope" is used below, it refers to the Angular scope object and not the scope of a name binding.</p>

                    <p>The tasks performed by the AngularJS bootstrapper occur in three phases[8] after the DOM has been loaded:

                        Creation of a new Injector
                        Compilation of the directives that decorate the DOM
                        Linking of all directives to scope
                        AngularJS directives allow the developer to specify custom and reusable HTML-like elements and attributes that define data bindings and the behavior of presentation components. Some of the most commonly used directives are:

                        ng-app
                        Declares the root element of an AngularJS application, under which directives can be used to declare bindings and define behavior.
                        ng-bind
                        Sets the text of a DOM element to the value of an expression. For example, <span ng-bind="name"></span> displays the value of ‘name’ inside the span element. Any change to the variable ‘name’ in the application's scope reflect instantly in the DOM.
                        ng-model
                        Similar to ng-bind, but establishes a two-way data binding between the view and the scope.
                        ng-model-options
                        Provides tuning for how model updates are done.
                        ng-class
                        Lets class attributes be dynamically loaded.
                        ng-controller
                        Specifies a JavaScript controller class that evaluates HTML expressions.
                        ng-repeat
                        Instantiate an element once per item from a collection. However, the inclusion of nested ng-repeat directive leading to the extension of JSON objects across multiple screens can deteriorate the performance of the app.[9]
                        ng-show & ng-hide
                        Conditionally show or hide an element, depending on the value of a boolean expression. Show and hide is achieved by setting the CSS display style.
                        ng-switch
                        Conditionally instantiate one template from a set of choices, depending on the value of a selection expression.
                        ng-view
                        The base directive responsible for handling routes that resolve JSON before rendering templates driven by specified controllers.
                        ng-if
                        Basic if statement directive that allow to show the following element if the conditions are true. When the condition is false, the element is removed from the DOM. When true, a clone of the compiled element is re-inserted
                        ng-aria
                        A module for accessibility support of common ARIA attributes.
                        ng-animate
                        A module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
                        Since ng-* attributes are not valid in HTML specifications, data-ng-* can also be used as a prefix. For example, both ng-app and data-ng-app are valid in AngularJS.</p>
